# dart_generator

This project is a generator for dart projects written in scala. The project was created to enable creating quick UIs in both web and app form 
of existing class structures stored on a server. It was created to eliminate the boilerplate required for dart and to make the code generically
support different outputs. The goal of this project was to solve a couple of repeated needs. 

* Create a simple website in a short period of time to display data (simulation results, logs, ...)
* Create a custom code generator targeted towards any language using (https://github.com/andywag/template_combinator)

The framework is in place to create a website based on a set of classes. This is a work in progress and not completely ready for use. Currently 
a basic website can be generated based on a generic set of classes but there are a few things required. 

* The scala wrapper around dart could use refactoring and cleanup for usability
